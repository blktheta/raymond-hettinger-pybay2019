Notes from Raymond Hettinger's *The Mental Game of Python* talk presented at PyBay2019 conference. The talk features 10 pythonic strategies for managing complexity in your code. 

The full talk is availbable at [YouTube][rh_pybay2019_yt], the code examples in the repo are based on the presentation code.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting started
First, [download][py_download_url] and install **Python**. Version `3.10.12` or higher is required.

That it it! Fire up your favourite text editor and open the **code/** directory.

## üîß Usage
Simply follow these two step:
1. Read through the docstring.
2. If given, solve the excercises.

If any concept outside the scope of the strategy being taught is not clear or familiar, take time to reasearch the subject before continuing.
